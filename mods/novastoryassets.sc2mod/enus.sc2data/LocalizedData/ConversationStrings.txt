Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00171=[Serious 75]Nova, we cannot acquire terrazine from this device any longer.[/Serious] [Angry 70]If we lose too many of them, we shall lose the challenge.[/Angry]

Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00184=[Serious 70]Nova, the Umojan records indicate that the researchers had additional mines here. I'd imagine they had to[/Serious] [Happy 65]leave some equipment behind.[/Happy]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00185=[Angry 70]Nova, the Tal'darim have destroyed one of the extraction devices.[/Angry] [Fear 60]We will not be able to collect terrazine from it.[/Fear]

Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00189=[Angry 60]They are moving to attack a device.[/Angry] [Fear 60]If they are successful, there will be one less source of terrazine available to us.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00190=[Serious 70]You have already agitated the enemy[/Serious]. Activating more [Fear 60]devices will incur additional risk.[/Fear]

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_010/Comment00003=NOVA is unconscious, slumped in a chair. She wears a hostile environment suit and a high tech visor that can be lowered over her eyes. A spotlight shines down on her and she wakes up.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_010/Comment00004=A 360 robotic camera lowers from the ceiling, monitoring her. We hear the WRANGLER'S voice through it.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_010/Comment00008=Parts of the robotic camera begin to rotate. In Nova's POV, the visor readout focuses on the robotic camera's appendages as they move threateningly. A new readout appears: THEY WILL KILL YOU. Then another: ESCAPE NOW.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00011=Nova in a nondescript room. Waiting. The exits are manned by armed MARINES. She's on edge, but keeping it cool.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00012=The door slides open. Another pair of marines enter. They step apart to reveal HORNER. Nova's surprised to see him.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00013=Nova's cautious, eyes scanning the room and everyone in it. Something's not adding up here. She stands at attention.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00014=He stares at her, brow furrowed.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00017=Nova's shock shows itself for a second before she masks it. The pieces start falling into place.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00019=On Nova, stunned. What comes next is the coup de grace.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00020=The guards tense up. Nova quickly assesses the situation, but is still reeling from the revelation.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00008=Nova... You've been MIA. You and several other ghosts haven't reported in for months.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00009=So I wasn't on a mission. And this isn't a debriefing. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00010=No, it's not. We have evidence that links you to a terrorist group known as the Defenders of Man. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00011=You're wanted for treason against the Terran Dominion.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00012=Treason? I've always been loyal to the Dominion. You know that.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00013=It's not my call. Valerian will have a lot of questions for you when he arrives.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00015=Look. I believe you, Nova. You're not the type to go AWOL. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00018=Thank you for escorting her down to this base. I want to keep things quiet.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00005=The news report is playing on the communicator. VALERIAN shuts it off as his guards escort NOVA into the room. She is wary about this situation. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00006=Valerian turns toward her.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00007=Reigel hands Nova a small circular device.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00008=Valerian isn't sure whether this is a criticism or a statement. A beat while he processes it.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00010=She considers for a moment.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00014=She attaches it to the neural inhibitor on the back of her neck. A wave of pain hits and Nova flinches, then grits her teeth to get through it. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00015=Reigel and Valerian exchange a look. Nova picks up on it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00016=Nova removes the device and sets it down, relieved but a little weary. She looks at Valerian.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00003=General Davis has supported the Emperor, while Magistrate Grayson says this could mean the worst for Valerian's regime--
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00010=And your rule.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00011=I am not the man my father was. I wish to serve a greater good... I think we have that much in common.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00015=Your new weapons and technology specialist. He has something for you.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00018=I'll be fine.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00019=It's not working. I just keep seeing the city where I grew up.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00020=But it's destroyed--covered in creep. I shouldn't remember it that way. I never went back after the zerg attacked.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00021=Hm, or perhaps you did.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00022=Why would the Defenders of Man operate out of Tarsonis?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00024=Nova... I'm glad to see you made it here safely.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00025=The Defenders of Man didn't make it easy.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00026=No... not for either of us. Yet, if we work together, I believe we can stop them--before they tear apart the Dominion.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00027=This ship is at your disposal, along with my covert ops crew. You will lead them--all I ask in return is your loyalty.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00028=Our scans show that your memories have been altered. But it may still be possible to recover them.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00029=This device sends an electric pulse through your neural inhibitor. The process is unpleasant, but it can restore recent memories.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00030=A good question. Go there, and find the answer.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00032=A good question. Go there, and find out.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00003=Reports are coming in from major population centers. They detail extensive damage--and high casualties. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00004=It seems all evacuation efforts were unsuccessful.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00005=How many zerg are there?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00006=Enough to vastly outnumber our forces, including all of the Dominion personnel on the world below. We are too late, Nova.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00007=Damn it!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00008=However... 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00010=Take us to the surface.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00015=...the Defenders of Man fleet is inbound. They have announced their intention to protect civilians.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00016=What's the situation out there, Reigel?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00017=So they want to look like heroes to these people... They're not--but we are.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_010/Line00018=<exasperated sigh>
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00001=INT. GRIFFIN'S HALLWAY
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00002=Nova strides down the hallway, tired and frustrated, rifle in hand. The Griffin has yet to depart from Tyrador IX. We hear screaming civilians over VO.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00003=INT. GRIFFIN'S BRIDGE
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00004=Reigel watches the newscast with quiet intensity. Onscreen: an image taken during the zerg attack on Tyrador. Screaming, chaos, death. Kate speaks over it at first, and then it shrinks to fit the PIP window.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00005=The image changes to a live feed of GENERAL DAVIS.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00006=INT. GRIFFIN'S HALLWAY
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00007=Nova continues down the hall, pausing at the door to the bridge. She furrows her brow. Something feels off.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00008=She opens the door and...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00009=INT. GRIFFIN'S BRIDGE
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00010=Nova steps in to the room. She sees Reigel in front of the monitor. The pilots are absent. Reigel turns to face her.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00011=Movement from the stairs catches Nova's eye. Time slows down as she sees a tall figure in black armor crest the top of the stairs and enter her view.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00012=It's Alarak. Nova's blood turns to ice. For a moment she stares, stunned at his presence on her ship, as Alarak steps onto the platform and approaches her. Then she springs into action.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00013=While their eyes are averted, Alarak surreptitiously places his hand on one of the ship's consoles. The UI flickers. He's clearly done something to the ship on the sly -- but Nova and Reigel didn't see it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00014=Nova starts to raise her rifle, but Reigel catches it with his cybernetic hand. Servos strain against Nova's strength. She glares at him; he shakes his head no. Alarak looks on, mildly amused.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00015=He gives her a "what else are we supposed to do?" look and steps aside. Alarak examines her like she's an exhibit at the zoo.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00016=Nova glances at Reigel. What did he just say?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00017=Alarak saunters around the bridge, examining its terran technology with unmasked disdain.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00018=Alarak turns to face Nova.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00019=Nova takes a beat to process this information, then scowls. She's still not entirely convinced she can trust Alarak.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00020=That last statement catches Alarak's attention. He focuses on her, psionically gleaning info from her mind. Nova realizes what he's doing, but she's too late to shield her thoughts.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00021=He approaches her again, gears turning, calculating.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00022=On Nova's reaction, alarmed but subdued.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00023=On Nova, grappling with the decision. Trusting Alarak, using terrazine... is it worth all of the risk, to bring down the Defenders of Man?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00024=She turns her attention back to the newscast, now muted. Davis's portrait is juxtaposed with footage of the destruction on Tyrador IX -- the Defenders' handiwork.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00025=Nova shares a grim look with Reigel. He's on board. She clenches her fist and makes her decision.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00002=We've reached out to General Davis of the Dominion's armed forces for comment. General?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00003=This is a terrible tragedy, Kate. My heart goes out to all its victims. The Dominion must protect them. Now, as for the protoss...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00004=Nova. We have a guest--
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00005=Ahem. May I introduce Alarak, Highlord of the Tal'darim.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00006=Hmph. For creatures with such short life spans, you terrans are always so eager to die. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00007=What do you want?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00009=The same as you...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00011=They destroyed a remote Tal'darim outpost, and then scurried away before the death fleet could retaliate.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00013=And you will find them for me. From what I understand, that's your area of expertise.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00014=If I knew where they were hiding, I'd already be there. But I can't remember anything.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00015=So you were once one of them. Well, you may be more useful than I anticipated.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00016=I suppose you've already attempted to restore your memories. Terran minds are so malleable. What you require... is terrazine.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00017=Terrazine? I don't even have access to it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00018=But I do. I will lead you to its source, in exchange for you taking me to the Defenders of Man. Do we have a bargain?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00019=We do... 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00021=Tensions run high in the wake of the battle. It is unclear whether the protoss meant to eliminate the zerg, or us as well.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00022=...to annihilate the Defenders of Man.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00023=For now.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00024=Such brazen disrespect demands retribution. I will exterminate them like the pests they are.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00025=Good... But be prepared, terran. You are in for a challenge.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_025/Line00006=Very little.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_025/Line00007=That's disturbing... Well, let's go find out what happened here.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_025/Line00008=The Umojan Protectorate sent a research colony to it years ago, but lost contact with their personnel.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00003=Nova and Reigel are standing in front of a communicator, in the middle of a conversation with Emperor Valerian, who is in his palace on Korhal.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00004=She raises the vial of refined terrazine into view. Valerian is alarmed.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00005=On the communicator feed, Horner enters the frame and motions to Valerian.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00006=The communicator shuts off and Nova turns to Reigel.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00007=She sits down and Reigel connects the vial to the neural inhibitor port on the back of her neck.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00008=His voice trails off, dreamlike, as Nova's eyes close. She twitches, seeing bursts of her previous escape from the Defenders of Man, almost like rewinding a tape.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00010=Gradually, the memories slow down. Nova is now reliving the events that took place before her last mission for the Defenders of Man.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00011=Nova is in their facility, but it is brighter and more relaxed. She is lying in the chair. The robot camera observes her, then shifts over to the side passively, shutting off.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00012=The Wrangler enters from the side of the frame. His headgear slides up to reveal a smiling face.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00013=They shake hands. It's clear they've been working together for some time.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00014=A Defenders of Man Trooper enters and hands Nova her gear. She is ready to go.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00001=Nova, your findings are compelling, but I can't take action against the Defenders of Man until we know who is leading them.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00002=I agree. That's why I have this.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00003=You've seen what terrazine does to people. No one should use it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00004=And yet... there is nothing more effective for memory restoration. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00005=(sigh)Do what you have to do.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00006=The protests are intensifying. You need to evacuate immediately.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00007=So be it. I will not have violence outside the palace. Nova, report back soon... and be careful.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00008=Seems like he could take his own advice...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00009=Oh, he won't. But as for the terrazine, I can make the process safer by administering it to you in microdoses.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00010=It will take longer to restore all of your memories, but the chances of a psychotic episode are greatly reduced.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00011=You've convinced me. Let's get started.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00012=Try to remember everything you see...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00013=Well done, Nova. You're ready for this.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00014=Thanks. It'll be a challenge, but working for the Dominion always is...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00015=We couldn't do any of this without you. Your visor should have the latest briefing.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00016=Oh, I've been meaning to tell you--it's been acting up lately...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00017=Don't worry. We'll update the software when you get back. Good luck out there.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00018=I remember the location of my last mission for the Defenders of Man. It's not much, but it might lead to something more...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00019=Are you all right?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00020=I agree. And that's why I have this.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00022=He's right. It's the only option we have.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00023=No psychotic episodes? You've convinced me. Let's get started.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00024=Thanks. The Defenders of Man have already done so much for the Dominion. I'm glad I was sent here to help out.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00025=The admiral wasn't lying when he said we'd be working with the best soldiers under his command.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00026=Your visor should have the latest briefing.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00027=I know where they sent me on my last mission. It's not much, but it might lead to something more...

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00011=I know what they did. They lied to me and used me to kill people--innocent people--for their damn cause. General Davis is leading them. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00012=Davis? She's always been loyal to my family.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00013=Your family, not you. As long as she's out there, more civilians will die. I can't let her live.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00014=No. People are calling for me to step down, and I will not see her become a martyr. I need to handle this the right way.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00003=Her desk is plain and utilitarian aside from a photo of her with Arcturus during the early days of the Sons of Korhal rebellion, when they were young idealists.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00004=The camera angle shifts, revealing that Davis has been looking at plans for the Defenders' psi-emitters. A recorded Adjutant's voice narrates the more compelling features of the emitters.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00006=Davis' expression hardens as she hears Valerian's name. She brings up a file on the emperor's involvement in his father's death, and plays a recording of his transmission to Kerrigan.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00007=Davis seethes. Valerian has killed his own father, and is unsuited to rule in his stead, in her view.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00004=One of the marines behind Valerian steps aside and Horner and a visor-down Nova lead a handcuffed Davis to the left of Valerian. She glowers at him, unmoved.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00005=The crowd reacts--shocked, but accepting Valerian's statements as true.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00006=But then... the people become restless. We hear the sound of ships approaching. It's the protoss!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00007=Tal'darim vessels blast over the crowd, followed by the immense shadow of a looming mothership. Alarak's forces have arrived!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00008=Valerian is interrupted by Alarak, who contacts the crowd telepathically. He winces, with Horner, Davis, Nova, and the marines also reacting behind him.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00009=Valerian is shocked. Davis looks on with disapproval.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00010=The camera moves past her to focus on Nova, who takes a few steps backwards as Alarak's speaks to her alone.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00011=Nova turns her back to the crowd and flips her visor up. She's horrified. This scenario is not what she intended when she made the deal with Alarak!

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00004=I take these allegations seriously.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00005=The truth is they used psi-emitters to incite the feral zerg to attack, and they have executed unprovoked strikes on the protoss as well.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00006=Our evidence is undeniable. The orders we recovered were issued by none other than General Carolina Davis.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00007=She is hereby under arrest and charged with treason against the Terran Dominion.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Comment00004=Nova shuts off the communicator. She lets out a breath she's been holding in. Reigel takes notice.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Comment00005=A light on the console flashes and the Dominion insignia appears on the communicator. Nova presses a button, and Valerian, aboard the Bucephalus, appears on the screen. He does not look pleased.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Comment00006=Valerian looks genuinely angry.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Comment00007=Now Nova's the one who's angry.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Comment00012=The communicator shuts off. Nova stews for a moment as Reigel looks on. She abruptly turns on her heel and heads for the bridge's exit, picking up her rifle on the way.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Line00009=Those were my father's tactics. Davis will answer for this, Nova. Track her down and bring her in to stand trial for her crimes.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Line00010=Bring her in? We've tried that. It didn't work.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_030/Line00011=There's only one way to stop her.

VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed06=I am this close to filing a formal complaint to administration!
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed07=Huh? Yes, I suppose that would be a poor idea. What are we doing? Shouldn't I return to my research?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Ready00=Humanity must advance!
VoiceOver/Scientist/Ready01=True science requires courage!
VoiceOver/Scientist/What00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Scientist/What01=Oh, I just had an idea!
