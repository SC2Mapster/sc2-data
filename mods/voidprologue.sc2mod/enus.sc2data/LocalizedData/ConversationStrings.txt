Conversation/Cutscene_PrologueOver/Line00004=Now I must return to my people. They will not understand my actions, but I will face their judgment--make them understand.
Conversation/Cutscene_PrologueOver/Line00005=For only Artanis, young Hierarch of the protoss, can unite our scattered factions as one... before Amon's wrath engulfs the galaxy.

Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00001=The Temple of Erris. Within those ancient walls lies our last hope...
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00002=Tal'darim, seal the temple! None enter until my work is done. Any who defies my order will answer to their Highlord with blood.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00003=The Tal'darim Highlord is here? This surely bodes ill...
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00004=Our difficulties do not end there, Zeratul. This world is in its death throes.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00005=These fissures are the last remaining source of vespene. We will have to brave them to raise our army.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00006=Zeratul, the planet's core pressure is rising. This counter will keep you aware of the current seismic pressure.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00007=Fissures are forming in these locations. We will need to move quickly to collect the vespene.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00008=Additional fissures detected in these locations.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00009=Zeratul, I am detecting another eruption. Fissure locations have been marked.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00010=Another breach is occurring. Marking the fissure locations now.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00011=Eruption imminent. Fissures are appearing here.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00012=The Tal'darim are mining these rock formations...
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00013=Yes. I'm detecting a strong seismic reading in those locations. They must hide something of value. We should take a closer look.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00014=Ah, a natural vespene vent. I will have the Void Seeker begin extracting it from orbit.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00015=A second vent has been discovered. Seismic readings indicate one more remains.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00016=Excellently done, Zeratul. The Void Seeker is now extracting vespene from all three vents.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00017=The Dark God has no use for you. He will not suffer you to live. 
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00019=This world and all its spoils belong to the Chosen!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00021=The Highlord demands your blood!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00025=I pray this temple of yours is worth it.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00027=The way forward is clear at last.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00028=The vespene reserves beneath the surface are turbulent. The planet is in a state of constant eruption.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00029=Yes, but the Tal'darim are not known to take defeat lightly. They will come to rescue their Highlord... and in force.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00030=Go, Zeratul. Find the answers you seek within the temple. Our blades shall grant you the time you need.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00031=You have my thanks, Talis. En taro Tassadar.

Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00033=Be prepared to move out, I expect a fissure will erupt shortly.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00034=The Dark God has no use for you. He will not suffer you to live. 
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00035=Another eruption will occur shortly. The vespene fissures will break forth here.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00036=Ready our forces. Another vespene eruption is about to occur. The fissure will be found here.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00037=Then he shall be disappointed.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue02/Line00038=Our forces are closing upon the temple. We should gather our warriors and strike as one.

Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00001=Highlord, the intruders breached the temple. They will be upon us shortly.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00002=Seal the access way! I will contact the master.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00003=As the Blade of Amon wills...
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00004=Indeed, but the access way has been sealed. The Tal'darim likely suspect an intrusion.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00006=Deliver these unbelievers unto the Void!

Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00011=That photon cannon will reveal my presence, but if I enshroud us in Void armor, we will be protected from its assault.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00014=A hybrid! My shadow strike shall be your undoing, abomination.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00022=We can go no further this way.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00025=This alcove overlooks the central chamber. That must be where Ma'lash has hidden.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00026=Abandon your fear, Ma'lash. Redemption is at hand. Your universe will be freed of its suffering.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00027=Ready your people for war, and await my command.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00029=The Tal'darim follow Amon to war! We are too late.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00030=There is still hope, Zeratul. That device... the Tal'darim are using it to communicate with Amon.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00031=Yes, and if we destroy it, we can delay Amon's forces long enough to warn Artanis. I will see it done.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00036=The catalyst is beyond my reach. I will need the aid of my stalkers to destroy it.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00037=A great power flows through here. It is as if the temple is linked directly to the Void itself.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00038=It is done. The Tal'darim are severed from Amon's guidance...
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00039=Zeratul, light is pouring from the temple!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00040=You are finally cornered, Nerazim! Tal'darim, the true god demands their death. Do not fail him.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00043=Cease your pointless crusade to prolong the suffering of existence. Give in, let me free you.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00047=My warriors and I have made our way inside and are holding back the Tal'darim. Make your way to us, now!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00048=I am on my way.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00049=This archway has collapsed. I must find another exit, quickly.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00051=Thank the gods, this pathway is clear. Talis, I am nearly upon you.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00052=Move quickly, Zeratul! I am detecting your signal now.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00054=Zeratul, the Tal'darim are retaliating. Hybrid are assaulting our forces. Have you made it into the temple safely?
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00055=My templar are engaged with the enemy, you will have to continue on alone for now. I will do my best to monitor your movements.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00057=Warriors, we must press on. The fate of our galaxy depends on it.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00061=There is no time, Zeratul. Make your escape. I will deal with the Tal'darim.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00063=For Aiur!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00064=Talis, our people owe you a debt we can never repay.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00069=Truth-bringer, the terrans have failed and led these intruders here. The great work is in jeopardy.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00070=It will be done.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00071=Well done. I am sending you reinforcements now.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00072=You've destroyed another cannon, I see... Well done! Reinforcements are inbound.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00073=The particle cannons have been destroyed, and I am sending you the last of our available forces. Fight with honor, brothers.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00076=Talis, I have been granted a vision from beyond--the answer to our salvation!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00077=Something's happening! I'm detecting a powerful fluctuation of void energies. 
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00082=Zeratul, the Keystone shall usher you unto hope.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00089=Slay it quickly, before it tears through your stalkers.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00090=An immortal. A single shadow strike should eliminate it.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00091=The Tal'darim have constructed anti-air cannons on the temple ramparts. Destroy them, Zeratul, and I can send you reinforcements.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00092=I sense an observer overhead. It will reveal my presence. We should navigate around.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00093=The Nerazim must proceed no further!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00094=The Dark Prelate is nearby... Find him!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00095=Do not let them reach the Highlord!

Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00101=Face the harbinger of the Dark God's wrath!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00103=Your salvation shall come by my hand alone. Let your suffering come to its end.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00104=There must be another way.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00105=Go. Now! And tell our Hierarch what has occurred this day.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00106=Eradicate them!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00107=Our lives for the Master!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00108=Your actions will not spare you from the sacred flame!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00113=Amon is collapsing the temple... I must leave now!
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00115=Tassadar! Can it be?
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00118=This should be the last of the Tal'darim's cannons.
Conversation/pMission_VoidPrologue03/Line00119=I believe another of the Tal'darim's cannons lies ahead.

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00005=Do not fear. We will not abandon this fight, Talis. If we are swift and clever, we can avoid the Swarm.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00006=Very well. I have made our nexus point ready for your arrival.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00009=Dark Prelate, we will need to cross the Swarm's attack route to reach the captives...

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00011=Slay the protoss. Their flesh will serve the master.

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00017=No response. (scoff) Better to reason with a stone than the zerg. The final cell awaits us, Zeratul. We should delay no longer.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00020=Kerrigan, you know as well as I that Amon lives. Slaying his hybrid is a meaningless act. We must awaken the xel'naga...
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00022=The terrans are warping in... Impossible!
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00023=They are experimenting with pylon technology! We should eliminate these terrans and reclaim the pylon for ourselves.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00024=Reclaiming the pylon now. It is hard to believe such primitive beasts could manipulate our technology.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00025=Both pylons have been returned to our rightful control. Warping in reinforcements now.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00026=The zerg are spawning more forces. We should move forward now.

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00043=Our brethren are being held prisoner across the complex. We must free them before the Swarm overwhelms the facility.

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00066=The hybrid are free! Strike them down!
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00067=The Swarm is [Surprise 60]upon you[/Surprise], [Serious 80]Moebius Corps.[/Serious] [Surprise 60]We are[/Surprise] a tide of [Angry 80]death that does not break.[/Angry]
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00068=[Surprise 60]Those who[/Surprise] side with [Serious 60]Amon's hybrid [/Serious]deserve[Serious 80] no mercy[/Serious]. [Angry 80]Devour them whole.[/Angry]

Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00070=The Swarm will begin another assault soon.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00071=Moebius and the Tal'darim both served under Narud's command. He would have known the location of this temple.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00072=Thank you, we believed the end was at hand.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00073=What do you know of this facility, zealot?
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00074=The terrans... tortured us, experimented upon our flesh. Most did not survive.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00075=I have seen foul work of this nature before, but Narud is dead. Whose hand brought you here?
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00076=Alas, I know not. Praetor, we wish to join you--to avenge our brothers in arms.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00077=Then ready yourselves, templar.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00078=The Tal'darim? Those heretics have never ventured so close to our worlds.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00080=You have aided me in my quest, Zeratul. I am honor bound to help you in yours. We shall help you claim this temple.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00081=[Serious 55]Your time[/Serious] is running [Surprise 40]short[/Surprise], [Serious 80]Zeratul[/Serious].
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00082=This place holds information I seek, and my captured brethren. I intend to free them both from the terrans' grip.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00083=This can only be the work of Amon. Templar, where were they holding you?
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00084=A xel'naga temple, unlike any I have seen. It was called Erris, but its location was kept a secret from us.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00085=[Surprise 60]Minions[/Surprise], target the [Serious 80]central reactor[/Serious]. [Angry 80]Go. Destroy.[/Angry]
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00086=Destroy the reactor. Now.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00087=[Serious 80]Eliminate Moebius Corps[/Serious]. This facility [Angry 80]will fall before the Swarm.[/Angry]
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00088=[Angry 60]Take down that reactor.[/Angry] [Serious 80]Amon [/Serious]will [Serious 80]not have[/Serious] his army as long as [Surprise 60]I live.[/Surprise]
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00089=The zerg are on the attack. Avoid them, brothers.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00090=Kerrigan is readying another assault. Be careful.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00091=The Atrias system! This is where Amon was reborn--deep within the sigma quadrant, and under Tal'darim guard.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00092=Warriors, you are nearing the zerg's hive cluster. Exercise caution.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00093=Well fought, brothers, but we should avoid the Swarm in the future.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00094=Do not test my patience. Do what you came here to do, but stay out of our way.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00095=I warned you, Zeratul.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00096=That path leads to the zerg's hive cluster. Engaging them directly would be a risky endeavor.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00097=Each time our warriors engage the zerg, we take unneeded damage. It would be better to avoid them entirely.
Conversation/vpMission_VoidPrologue01/Line00098=The zerg's presence is strong in that area. We should not engage their hive without good cause.
