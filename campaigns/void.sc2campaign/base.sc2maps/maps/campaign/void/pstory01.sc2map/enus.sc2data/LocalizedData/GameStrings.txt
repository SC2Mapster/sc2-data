UserData/Scenes/Alpha02_Description=Artanis is going to send down a crack squad to retake the artifact, then assault Alpha Squad. They question what should be done. Alarak says they should kill them all. Mohandar disagrees. But, Artanis (and the player) won’t let this evil stand anymore. The time has come for payback - to get retribution. Though the Dae’uhl forbids the burning of worlds without great cause and this is a spear of adun weapon - but the Dae’uhl doesn’t apply to Amon.
